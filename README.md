# Tailwind Theme For WP With a Bunch of Tools 
## Tools
- Tailwind CSS
- PostCSS
- Laravel Mix
- JS Components
- BEM
## CLI
- `npm run watch`: runs `npx mix watch`, will monitor `/src` and all php files for changes
- `npm run dev`: runs `npx mix` once and closes
- `npm run prod`: runs `npx mix --production`, compiles prod assets
## Adding Components
1. Add PHP template file in `/components`
2. Add CSS file in `/src/css/components` and add import to `/src/css/app.css`
  - Best practice is to name the css file  the same as the php template for easier searching.
  - Use the same name as the wrapping classname
3. Add JS file in `/src/js/components` (when js is needed)
  - No need to import these. In the template file add `data-component="{name}"` as an attr. The js file will be loaded once an reinstatiated for subsequent uses. The element the attr is placed on will be passed to the js function or classs per-use.
4. To use, call `get_component({name}, [$args])`
  - Pass the name of the component (filename of php template) as the first parm and a name-indexed array as the second. It will grab that template and break up the array into variables.

## Other Theme Notes
- This theme relies heavily on ACF. The theme may not work without it
- Demo is viewable on the home page. It is static html found in `/templates/page-home.php`
## TODO
- Reorganize components a little:
  - Create folders in `/components`, such as `/components/card/card.php`
  - Move JS/CSS files into these folders
  - Create PostCSS Task to grab all component CSS files instead of importing them individually
- Bash script to create new components
- Create a Carbon Fields version of the theme (new branch)
